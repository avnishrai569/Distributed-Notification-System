# Future Scope for Distributed Notification System

## 1. Scalability Enhancements
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Use Kubernetes for service auto-scaling.
- **Kafka Partitioning**: Increase Kafka partitions to distribute load effectively.
- **MongoDB Sharding**: Enable sharding for managing large datasets.

## 2. Feature Improvements
- **User Notification History**: Store historical data in cold storage for analytics.
- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Add tenant-specific configurations.
- **Dynamic Quiet Hours**: Allow users to set dynamic quiet hours per day.

## 3. Security Upgrades
- **Authentication**: Integrate OAuth2 or JWT for secure API access.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data in MongoDB and during transmission.

## 4. Analytics Dashboard
- Add visualization of delivery stats using tools like Grafana or Kibana.
- Include advanced filters for channel, priority, and time range.

## 5. Additional Notification Channels
- Integrate social media (e.g., WhatsApp, Slack).
- Support voice calls for high-priority alerts.

## 6. Optimization
- Implement Redis caching for frequent queries (e.g., quiet hours check).
- Use gRPC for faster inter-service communication.

## 7. Monitoring and Logging
- Add centralized logging with Elasticsearch and Kibana.
- Integrate Prometheus for real-time system metrics.
